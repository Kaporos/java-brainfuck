# JAVA Brainfuck Interpreter

Full implementation of [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck)

This project is really simple tbh, it's just for java drill purposes.

# Usage

This project uses intellij as the build system

Just edit main.bf with whatever brainfuck you like (you can also pass a brainfuck file name in param, otherwise "main.bf" will be the default.)
